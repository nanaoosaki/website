## Building a Personal Portfolio Website (3/31/2025, 5:50:37 AM)

_**User**_

I want to build a website to basically showcase and display my projects and repos and make certain projects to turn it into a working site ; here's an example that seemed to used github to build this integrated hub for her projects "https://chriszhang6.github.io/chris_website/"; how can I do a similar thing, and her app seemed to be hosted through heroku.com, if I want to do a similar thing, how can I achieve that

<think>
The user wants to build a personal website to showcase their projects and repositories, similar to the example they provided. They've specifically mentioned that the example website is hosted through Heroku, and they want to know how to achieve something similar.

Let's break down what they need:
1. A website to showcase their projects and repositories
2. Ability to display project information, potentially integrated with GitHub
3. Guidance on hosting the website (they mentioned Heroku as an example)

To help them, I'll need to:
1. Explore options for building a personal portfolio website
2. Explain how to integrate with GitHub to display repositories
3. Provide information on hosting options, including Heroku

Since they haven't provided any existing code, I'll need to give them guidance on how to start from scratch. Let's start by exploring some common approaches to building a portfolio website and then discuss hosting options.

I should also check if they already have any files in their workspace that might be relevant.

I'd be happy to help you build a personal portfolio website to showcase your projects! Let's start by checking if you have any existing files in your workspace.

_**Assistant**_

I see you're starting with a mostly empty workspace. Let's build a modern portfolio website from scratch that will showcase your projects and integrate with GitHub repositories. Here's my plan:

1. Create a Next.js application (modern React framework)
2. Set up a responsive design with Tailwind CSS
3. Create components to fetch and display your GitHub repositories
4. Add sections for featured projects, about me, skills, etc.
5. Deploy to a hosting platform (I'll cover options including Heroku)

Let's start by setting up a new Next.js project:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

---

_**Assistant**_

It looks like you don't have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Let's first install Node.js, which will include npm and npx. I'll guide you through a manual installation:

1. First, let's install Node.js:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.1/node-v20.11.1-x64.msi -OutFile node-installer.msi" && start node-installer.msi
```

---

_**Assistant**_

This should have opened the Node.js installer. Please complete the installation process, and then let me know when it's done.

As an alternative approach, let's create the portfolio website using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which doesn't require Node.js installation. This will be a simpler approach but still effective for creating a portfolio site.

Let's start by creating the basic file structure:

before we do anything, let's set up this repo properly so that we can document our progress and check in the codes regularly to github as well. here's a git repo I want you to clone all the files directly into this directry, no parent folder created. @https://github.com/nanaoosaki/devin.cursorrules/tree/multi-agent

The user wants me to set up a local workspace by cloning a GitHub repository directly into the current directory without creating a parent folder. The repository is https://github.com/nanaoosaki/devin.cursorrules/tree/multi-agent.

I need to use the `git clone` command with the `--no-checkout` flag first to prevent creating a parent directory, then manually extract the files. This approach will allow us to get the repository contents directly in the current workspace.

I'll help you clone the GitHub repository directly into the current directory without creating a parent folder. Let's do this step by step.
